German Terms of Service for a Friendica node
============================================

Howdy. If you are German and you are running your own Friendica node, you might
be interested in this project. There are a lot of evil lawyers in Germany,
kicking people when they have no imprint and similar stuff.

So we decided to talk with some lawyers and write some easy-to-understand but
legally valid terms of service for your Friendica node. If you want to, use them,
they are licensed under the CC-BY license.

You have an idea? Submit a pull request and we merge it in! :-)

This terms of service where originally written by [Dennis Schubert](https://github.com/denschub) 
for Diaspora-Pods. You can find [the original documents here](https://github.com/geraspora/german-terms-of-service)

Usage
=====

The terms_of_service.txt is intended to be used with the Friendica "Impressum"-Plugin bei [Tobias Diekersdorf](https://github.com/tobiasd).

Install the [Friendica addons](https://github.com/friendica/friendica-addons) on your friendica node and activate the "Impressum"-Plugin in the admin menu.

Add your details in the admin page of that plugin and paste the terms_of_service.txt into the "Hinweise"-Field. Edit the text as needed.
